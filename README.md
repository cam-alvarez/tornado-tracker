# TornadoTrackerüå™Ô∏è

The TornadoTracker App is designed to revolutionize how individuals receive tornado warnings. By leveraging the capabilities of machine learning with the AlexNet convolutional neural network, the app offers precise and timely tornado detection. Its primary aim is to analyze live weather radar images, identify potential tornado formations, and provide immediate, localized alerts. This proactive approach aims to enhance safety during severe weather conditions, especially during the night when the risk of undetected tornadoes is greatest. The TornadoTracker App is about empowering users with advanced warning, maximizing preparedness and response time for communities worldwide.

## üö® Tornado Detection Challenge
Tornadoes pose a significant threat to safety, especially when they strike unexpectedly. Current systems for tornado detection and warning are often inadequate, leading to delayed responses and increased risk, particularly at night. Our app aims to address these challenges head-on, offering a more effective solution.

- **Limited Localized Warnings:** 
  - Current severe weather forecasting systems provide broad area warnings, lacking precision for localized tornado paths.
  - General alerts cover large areas, failing to pinpoint specific neighborhoods or streets at risk.
- **Night Time Tornadoes:** 
  - Higher casualty and injury rates at night due to decreased visibility and lower public awareness.
  - Many people are asleep and miss warnings, increasing the risk of harm.
- **Lack of Expertise Among the Public:** 
  - Most individuals lack the skills to accurately interpret weather radar imagery.
  - This lack of knowledge leads to delayed or missed responses during critical moments.
- **Global Applicability:** 
  - Numerous regions worldwide are devoid of advanced weather reporting systems.
  - These areas, however, often have access to live radar images but lack the means to analyze and communicate warnings effectively.

  - AlexNet, a proven convolutional neural network, classifies live weather radar images.
  - Categorizes images into two distinct groups: tornado and no-tornado.
- **Data Processing and Training:** 
  - Model trained on a curated dataset featuring labeled images of diverse weather patterns.
  - Focuses particularly on identifying the unique signatures of tornadoes.
- **Advanced Feature Extraction:** 
  - AlexNet's deep layers are adept at capturing complex patterns in meteorological imagery.
  - These capabilities are crucial for distinguishing tornadoes from other weather phenomena.
- **Real-Time Analysis and Response:** 
  - The app analyzes live radar feeds continuously, using the trained model for instant detection.
  - Ensures timely and accurate alerts to users in potential tornado paths.
- **Visual Insights Through Feature Maps:** 
  - AlexNet provides feature maps, offering a window into what the model prioritizes in predictions.
  - These visualizations aid in understanding and improving model performance.
