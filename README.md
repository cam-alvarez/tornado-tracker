## üö® Tornado Detection Challenge
> Tornadoes pose a significant threat to safety, especially when they strike unexpectedly. Current systems for tornado detection and warning are often inadequate, leading to delayed responses and increased risk, particularly at night. Our app aims to address these challenges head-on, offering a more effective solution.

- **Limited Localized Warnings:** 
  - Current severe weather forecasting systems provide broad area warnings, lacking precision for localized tornado paths.
  - General alerts cover large areas, failing to pinpoint specific neighborhoods or streets at risk.
- **Night Time Tornadoes:** 
  - Higher casualty and injury rates at night due to decreased visibility and lower public awareness.
  - Many people are asleep and miss warnings, increasing the risk of harm.
- **Lack of Expertise Among the Public:** 
  - Most individuals lack the skills to accurately interpret weather radar imagery.
  - This lack of knowledge leads to delayed or missed responses during critical moments.
- **Global Applicability:** 
  - Numerous regions worldwide are devoid of advanced weather reporting systems.
  - These areas, however, often have access to live radar images but lack the means to analyze and communicate warnings effectively.

### **Feature Map Comparisons**
> Feature maps are the outputs of various layers within AlexNet. They represent how the network processes and identifies patterns in the input images. Initially capturing basic features like edges and colors, they progressively reveal more complex patterns in deeper layers.
> 
> **Application in Tornado Detection**
> 
> - **Pattern Recognition:** Feature maps help AlexNet identify specific signatures in radar images that are indicative of tornadoes and thunderstorms. This includes recognizing unique shapes, intensities, and movements often associated with severe weather conditions.
> 
> - **Enhancing Accuracy:** By analyzing these maps, we can understand and improve how the network distinguishes between normal weather patterns and potential severe weather threats, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of our tornado detection system.

### High-Response Filters: Unveiling Key Features in Storm Detection
High-response filters in our neural network play a pivotal role in analyzing storm relative velocity radar images. These filters are highly reactive to certain features in the data, providing valuable insights into the distinguishing characteristics of tornadoes and thunderstorms.

- **Identifying Contrast and Defining Features:**
  Our analysis revealed that both tornadoes and thunderstorms elicit strong responses from specific filters, particularly in areas of high contrast. This characteristic is crucial as it highlights the most defining features of these weather phenomena, accentuating their differences and their possible similarities

&ensp;

### Low-Response Filters: Capturing Subtle Distinctions
On the other hand, the low-response filters are less sensitive but equally important. They often reveal subtle, yet critical, details that high-response filters might overlook.

- **Revealing Finer Details:**
  These filters may show weaker responses, indicating fewer similarities between the filter pattern and the image. However, this subtlety is key to uncovering less obvious features that distinguish tornadoes from thunderstorms.
- **Detecting Motion and Subtle Changes:**
  In particular, the low-response filters were more adept at picking up nuanced aspects like motion, which can be inferred from curvature and color changes in storm relative velocity radar images. These features, though less conspicuous than high-contrast areas, are vital for a comprehensive understanding of storm dynamics.
